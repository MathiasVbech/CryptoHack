The mathematical term for a one-to-one correspondence is a "bijection" or a "bijective function."
A bijection is a function that is both:

Injective (one-to-one): Each element in the domain maps to a distinct element in the codomain, meaning no two different inputs produce the same output.
Surjective (onto): Every element in the codomain is mapped to by some element from the domain, meaning every possible output value is used.

In the context of AES and other block ciphers, this bijective property is essential because it guarantees that:

Encryption produces unique ciphertexts for different plaintexts (injective property)
Every possible ciphertext can be decrypted back to a plaintext (surjective property)
Decryption is the inverse operation of encryption, retrieving the original plaintext

This mathematical property ensures the reversibility that's crucial for encryption and decryption to work properly.
