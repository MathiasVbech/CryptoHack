The best single-key attack against AES is known as the "biclique attack."

This attack, published in 2011 by Bogdanov, Khovratovich, and Rechberger, represents the most significant analytical breakthrough against the full AES algorithm. It reduces the security of AES-128 from 128 bits to approximately 126.1 bits, which is a marginal improvement over brute force but still represents a theoretical break according to cryptographic standards.

The biclique attack uses a meet-in-the-middle approach with a specialized structure called "bicliques" to create shortcuts in the search space. Despite this clever approach, the attack remains practically infeasible due to the enormous computational requirements.
