# CryptoHack Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the CryptoHack challenges.
About the Solutions
Each file in this repository is a Python script corresponding to a specific CryptoHack challenge. A few important notes:

Each script contains only the code used to solve the challenge
There are minimal to no explanatory comments in the scripts
The code focuses on functionality, not educational explanations

## Recommendation to Users
If you're using this repository:

* Try solving challenges on your own first - the learning happens in the struggle!
* Understand the concepts - if you use my solutions, take time to understand the cryptographic principles behind them
* Don't just copy and paste - these scripts solve the challenges but don't necessarily explain the underlying logic

## Repository Structure
Files are named according to the challenge they solve, organized following CryptoHack's category structure.
Disclaimer

The purpose of sharing these solutions is not to provide shortcuts but to offer reference implementations for those who want to compare approaches after solving the challenges themselves.
These solutions represent my personal approach - there are often multiple valid ways to solve cryptographic challenges.
